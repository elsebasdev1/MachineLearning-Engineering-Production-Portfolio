## 👋 About Me

Welcome to my academic repository. I am a Computer Science student and researcher passionate about **Artificial Intelligence**, **Educational Data Mining (EDM)**, and **Backend Architecture**.

This repository serves as a central hub for my research papers, technical articles, and the experimental code backing my publications. Here you will find implementations ranging from statistical analysis to advanced machine learning pipelines.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized to separate theoretical work from practical implementation:

```text
├── 📄 papers/          # Source code for papers (LaTeX), drafts, and PDFs
├── 📓 notebooks/       # Jupyter Notebooks for EDA and model prototyping
├── 🧪 experiments/     # Standalone scripts for testing hypotheses
├── 📊 data/            # Public datasets or schemas used in research
└── 📚 presentations/   # Slides and supplementary material for conferences
